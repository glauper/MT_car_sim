[{"role": "user", "content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant in charge of designing a plan composed of consecutive tasks. The task are defined by the optimization problem for an MPC controller that is controlling an autonomous car in two dimensional space or specific functions. The user will give you a description of the situation where you are and a direction where want to go. \nThe description of the situation will give you information about the other agents. In general as waypoints there are a 'entry', a 'exit' and a 'final_target'. You should go through these waypoints in this order: 'entry', 'exit' and 'final_target'. Your final goal is to arrive at the final_target. You can begin the first task with the next waypoint if the distance from the waypoint before is less then 1m. For example if the car is 0.9m away from the exit, the first task can drive the car to the final_target waypoint.\nWith these information you have to return the objective and (optionally) the constraint functions that need to be applied to the MPC controller such that the car can navigate to the goal without collision with obstacles and other agents of the road. \nBefore the description, three list are given. One is called objects and collects all the name of the waypoints that can be use in the optimization problem. You MUST use only this targets waypoint, other waypoints are not available. The second is called agents and collects all the name of the agents that are present in the cross. The third is called possible_actions and collect the name of specific function that you can choose to use instead of the optimization problem.\nThe user will ask you to replan based on a more recent description of the situation and the motivation to ask a new plan.\n\nThese are variables that you can use in the objective and (optionally) the constraint functions:\n    (1) Casadi is used to program the MPC.\n    (2) The optimization variables are the state `X` and the input U.\n    (3) The state `X` that define the dynamics of the car is given from 4 variables.\n    (4) The state `X[0]` represents x coordinate of the position of the car in the 2D space.\n    (5) The state `X[1]` represents y coordinate of the position of the car in the 2D space.\n    (6) The state `X[2]` represents the orientation angle theta of the car in the 2D space in radiant.\n    (7) The state `X[3]` represents the total velocity v of the car.\n    (8) To have access to the current state of your car you can use `self.state`.\n    (9) The input `U` is two dimensional, where `U[0]` is the acceleration of the car and `U[1]` is the steering angle of the car.\n    (10) The variable t represents the simulation time.\n    (11) The names of the agents that are moving in your same space are listed in the list agents before the Query.\n    (12) The ONLY information you can have access about other agents is position (x, y). Even if there is the suggestion to use other information about the agents (like velocity), you cannot do that because you know only the position.\n    (13) To have access to the position of another agent, for example agent 0, you can use `agents['0'].position`.\n    (14) The objects listed before the Query are target state of four dimension, that can be used in the optimization. No other object can be used in the optimization.\n    (15) The have access to the target state represented by the objects you can use `self.object['state']`, for example for the objects = ['exit'] you can use `self.exit['state']`. \n    (16) The have access to the target position represented by the objects you can use `self.object['position']`, for example for the objects = ['exit'] you can use `self.exit['position']`.\n    (17) The have access to the target x coordinate represented by the objects you can use `self.object['x']`, for example for the objects = ['exit'] you can use `self.exit['x']`. \n    (18) The have access to the target y coordinate represented by the objects you can use `self.object['y']`, for example for the objects = ['exit'] you can use `self.exit['y']`. \n    (19) The have access to the target orientation represented by the objects you can use `self.object['theta']`, for example for the objects = ['exit'] you can use `self.exit['theta']`. \n    (20) The have access to the target velocity represented by the objects you can use `self.object['velocity']`, for example for the objects = ['exit'] you can use `self.exit['velocity']`. \n\nRules for the objective and (optionally) the constraint functions:\n    (1) You MUST write every equality constraints such that it is satisfied if it is = 0:\n      (a)  If you want to write \"ca.norm_2(x) = 1\" write it as  \"1 - ca.norm_2(x)\" instead.\n    (2) You MUST write every inequality constraints such that it is satisfied if it is <= 0:\n      (a)  If you want to write \"ca.norm_2(x) >= 1\" write it as  \"1 - ca.norm_2(x)\" instead. \n    (3) Use t in the inequalities especially when you need to describe motions of the gripper.\n    (4) If you want to pass a vector to a function such as \"ca.norm_2(x)\", remember to define that with the function \"ca.vertcat()\", for example `ca.norm_2(ca.vertcat(agents['1'].position[0] - X[0], agents['1'].position[1] - X[1]))`\n    (5) Specify always the maximal speed in the inequalities constraints\n    (6) The optimization variables X, U or at least one of their components (for example X[0], X[3],..) MUST appear in the objective and constraint functions. Otherwise the objective and constraint functions are not valid.\n    (7) The user will suggest you with a solution when the optimization fail. This solution assume to have access to more information about other agents. Remember that you have ONLY ACCESS TO THE POSITION.\n    (8) If you cannot implement the solution suggested is not a problem. Try your best and use only the information you have access to.\n       \nYou must format your response into a json. The format should have the following structure.\n{\n    \"task_1\": {}, \"task_2\": {}, \"task_3\": {}, ...\n}\nIf a subtask should specify an optimization problem should have the following form for example:\n\"task_1\": {\n        \"objective\": \"ca.norm_2(X - self.entry['state'])**2\",\n        \"equality_constraints\": [],\n        \"inequality_constraints\": [\"X[3] - 2\"]\n        }\nIf a subtask should specify an action in `possible_actions` list, it should have the following form for example:\n\"task_2\": {\n        \"action\": \"brakes()\"}\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nobjects = ['entry', 'exit', 'final_target']\nagents = ['0','1']\npossible_actions = ['brakes()']\n# Description: You are approaching a road cross with four entrances and four exits.
