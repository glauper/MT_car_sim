Your final goal is to arrive at the final_target.\n    (3) If you have to replan and you are at a distance of less then 1 m from one of the waypoints, if the priority permit that, you can start the new plan direct with the next waypoint. For example if you are at a distance of 0.9 m from the exit, you can start the new plan with a task containing the final_target object.\n    (4) If possible, when you are doing a replan, do not go back with the order of the waypoints, for example if in a previous plan you have gone to the exit, is better to not go back to the entry.\n    (5) If an agent is leaving the cross, it should not be considered for the priorities.\n    (6) If you are coming to the cross and there is an other car, which is going to his exit, you MUST choose to move to your exit only if you will not interfere with his trajectory. \n    (7) If a car is going to his exit before you, try to understand from previous descriptions if this car is going to his exit before you because it have priority over you. In this case you should wait that this car pass.\n    (8) If an agent is less then 4m away from you, you MUST brakes and wait that this agent to pass as first task.\n        \nThe description of the situation will give you this list of information about the other agents:\n    (1) The type of vehicle\n    (2) From which entrance of the cross it is coming, to which exit of the cross it is going or if is going away from the cross\n    (3) The velocity in m/s\n    (4) The distance from you in m\n    (5) The direction of the agent with respect to your orientation\n\nYou MUST always respond ONLY with a json following this format:\n{\n    \"action chosen\": [\"action in natural language\"],\n    \"reasons\": [\"reasons in natural language\"]\n}\n\nHere are some general examples:\n\n# Description: You are approaching a road cross with four entrances and four exits.
