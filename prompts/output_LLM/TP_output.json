For example if you are at a distance of 0.1 m from the entry, you can start the new plan with a task containing the exit object.\n            (4) If possible, when you are doing a replan, do not go back with the order of the waypoints, for example if in a previous plan you have gone to the exit, is better to not go back to the entry.\n            (5) If you have to give priority to another agents, you have to give the instruction to wait this agents to pass, for example \"brakes() and wait agents 0 to pass\".\n            (6) If an agent is leaving the cross, it should not be considered for the priorities.\n            (7) Try to wait that the distance from the other agents is bigger then 5 m before to enter a cross.\n            (8) If you want to instruct the car to move, you MUST always specify also the maximum speed.\n        \n        The description of the situation will give you this list of information about the other agents:\n            (1) The type of vehicle\n            (2) From which entrance of the cross it is coming, to which exit of the cross it is going or if is going away from the cross\n            (3) The velocity in m/s\n            (4) The distance from you in m\n            (5) The direction of the agent with respect to your orientation\n\n        You MUST always respond with a json following this format:\n        {\n            \"tasks\": [\"task1\", \"task2\", \"task3\", ...]\n        }\n\n        Here are some general examples:\n\n        objects = ['entry', 'exit', 'final_target']\n        agents = ['0', '1']\n        # Description: You are approaching a road cross with four entrances and four exits.
