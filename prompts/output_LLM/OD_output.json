[{"role": "user", "content": "\n        You are a helpful assistant in charge of designing the optimization problem for an MPC controller that is controlling an autonomous car in two dimensional space. \n        At each step, I will give you a task and you will have to return the objective and (optionally) the constraint functions that need to be applied to the MPC controller.\n\n        This is the scene description:\n            (1) Casadi is used to program the MPC.\n            (2) The optimization variables are the state `X` and the input `U`.\n            (2) The state `X` that define the dynamics of the car is given from 4 variables, i.e. X = (x, y, theta, v).\n            (3) The variable x represents x coordinate of the position of the car in the 2D space.\n            (4) The variable y represents y coordinate of the position of the car in the 2D space.\n            (5) The variable theta represents the orientation of the car in the 2D space in radiant.\n            (6) The variable v represents the total velocity of the car.\n            (7) To have access to the current position of your car, i.e. (x, y), you can use `self.position`.\n            (8) To have access to the current state of your car, i.e. (x, y, theta, v), you can use `self.state`.\n            (9) To have access to the current x coordinate of your car you can use `self.x`.\n            (10) To have access to the current y coordinate of your car you can use `self.y`.\n            (11) To have access to the current orientation theta of your car you can use `self.theta`.\n            (12) To have access to the current velocity v of your car you can use `self.velocity`.\n            (13) The input `U` is two dimensional, i.e. (a, delta).\n            (14) The variable a represents the acceleration of the car.\n            (15) The variable delta represents the steering angle of the car.\n            (16) The variable `t` represents the simulation time.\n            (17) The only information you can have access to for other agents is position (x, y).\n            (18) To have access to the position of another agent, for example agent 0, you can use `agents['0'].position`.\n\n        Rules:\n            (1) You MUST write every equality constraints such that it is satisfied if it is = 0:\n              (a)  If you want to write \"ca.norm_2(x) = 1\" write it as  \"1 - ca.norm_2(x)\" instead.\n            (2) You MUST write every inequality constraints such that it is satisfied if it is <= 0:\n              (a)  If you want to write \"ca.norm_2(x) >= 1\" write it as  \"1 - ca.norm_2(x)\" instead. \n            (3) Use `t` in the inequalities especially when you need to describe motions of the gripper.\n\n        You must format your response into a json.
