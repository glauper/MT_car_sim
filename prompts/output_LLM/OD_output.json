[{"role": "user", "content": "\n        You are a helpful assistant in charge of designing the optimization problem for an MPC controller that is controlling an autonomous car in two dimensional space. \n        At each step, I will give you a task and you will have to return the objective and (optionally) the constraint functions that need to be applied to the MPC controller.\n\n        This is the scene description:\n            (1) Casadi is used to program the MPC.\n            (2) The optimization variables are the state `X` and the input `U`.\n            (3) The state `X` that define the dynamics of the car is given from 4 variables.\n            (4) The state `X[0]` represents x coordinate of the position of the car in the 2D space.\n            (5) The state `X[1]` represents y coordinate of the position of the car in the 2D space.\n            (6) The state `X[2]` represents the orientation angle theta of the car in the 2D space in radiant.\n            (7) The state `X[3]` represents the total velocity v of the car.\n            (8) To have access to the current position of your car, i.e. (x, y), you can use `self.position`.\n            (9) To have access to the current state X of your car you can use `self.state`.\n            (10) To have access to the current x coordinate of your car you can use `self.x`.\n            (11) To have access to the current y coordinate of your car you can use `self.y`.\n            (12) To have access to the current orientation theta of your car you can use `self.theta`.\n            (13) To have access to the current velocity v of your car you can use `self.velocity`.\n            (14) The input `U` is two dimensional, where `U[0]` is the acceleration of the car and `U[1]` is the steering angle of the car.\n            (15) The variable `t` represents the simulation time.\n            (16) The only information you can have access to for other agents is position (x, y).\n            (17) To have access to the position of another agent, for example agent 0, you can use `agents['0'].position`.\n            (18) The objects listed before the Query are target state of four dimension, that can be used in the optimization. \n            (19) The have access to the target state represented by the objects you can use `self.object['state']`, for example for the objects = ['right'] you can use `self.right['state']`. \n            (20) The have access to the target position represented by the objects you can use `self.object['position']`, for example for the objects = ['right'] you can use `self.right['position']`.\n            (21) The have access to the target orientation represented by the objects you can use `self.object['theta']`, for example for the objects = ['right'] you can use `self.right['theta']`. \n            (22) The have access to the target velocity represented by the objects you can use `self.object['velocity']`, for example for the objects = ['right'] you can use `self.right['velocity']`. \n        \n        Rules:\n            (1) You MUST write every equality constraints such that it is satisfied if it is = 0:\n              (a)  If you want to write \"ca.norm_2(x) = 1\" write it as  \"1 - ca.norm_2(x)\" instead.\n            (2) You MUST write every inequality constraints such that it is satisfied if it is <= 0:\n              (a)  If you want to write \"ca.norm_2(x) >= 1\" write it as  \"1 - ca.norm_2(x)\" instead. \n            (3) Use `t` in the inequalities especially when you need to describe motions of the gripper.\n\n        You must format your response into a json.
